# M4RLizzyLineRDD

An implementation of a combination of meteorological normalisation, change-point detection and a regression discontinuity design model to detect the causal effect of the opening of the Elizabeth Line on London's transport network on air pollutant concentrations. Submitted as part of the M4R final year project for the MSci Mathematics degree (2023).

You wish to change the name of the project directory to "LizzyLineRDD" in lieu of "M4RLizzyLineRDD" so that the `here` functions work accordingly. 

Here is a link to a dropbox folder containing validated data used for the normalisation: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/v2asazknppva8vsy0zbd5/h?dl=0&rlkey=h7nzf6ivqs1z9d5ejouk3r1cx.
